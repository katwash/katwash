# About Me! ğŸ‘‹


**katwash/katwash** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on everything. I have too many projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Bachelors Degree in IT focused on Project Management

- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all of this stuff
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything except for myself
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: carrier pigeon
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am horrible at math but chose to get a degree in the STEM field, so I am extra behind ğŸ˜‘
